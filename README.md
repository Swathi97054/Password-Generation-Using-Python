# ​ Password Generator Using Python

##  Overview
A password generator is a tool that creates secure and random passwords to enhance security. This program generates passwords based on user-defined length and complexity by including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The program uses Python’s random module to generate unpredictable passwords.The user selects the password length. The user chooses whether to include numbers and special characters.At least one character from each selected category is added.The remaining characters are randomly chosen.The password is shuffled to prevent patterns.

A simple yet effective Python script for generating secure, random passwords. Perfect for automating strong password creation for personal or learning purposes.

##  Features
- Allows specification of **password length**
- Optionally includes:
  - Lowercase letters
  - Uppercase letters
  - Digits
  - Special characters
- Generates and displays the password directly in the console
- Simple to extend with advanced features like entropy checks or clipboard support

##  Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Swathi97054/Password-Generation-Using-Python.git
    cd Password-Generation-Using-Python
    ```

2. **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python "password generator.py"
    ```

3. **Follow the prompts** in the console to customize password length and character choices.

---

##  Dependencies
No external dependencies—uses Python’s built-in `random` and `string` modules.

> **Security Tip:** For increased security, consider using Python’s `secrets` module instead of `random`, as it is designed for generating cryptographically secure values :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

##  How It Works
The script performs the following steps:

1. Prompts the user for the desired password length.
2. Prompts to include character categories (letters, digits, punctuation).
3. Builds a character set based on user choices.
4. Randomly selects characters from this set to create the password.
5. Outputs the final password to the console.

##  Example Addition (Advanced Usage)

If you're looking to upgrade the generator with cryptographic security, here’s a simple snippet using the `secrets` module:

```python
import secrets
import string

def generate_secure_password(length=16):
    alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
    return ''.join(secrets.choice(alphabet) for _ in range(length))

print(generate_secure_password())
